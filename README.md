# MatlabRCV
This is a MATLAB Script and associated functions that can be used to tabulate the result of a ranked choice election. 

This script allows for any number of candidates greater than 2, as well as a maximum number of candidates a voter can vote for.

Your voter data should be a .csv file with only 1 sheet. All the data should be an integer. This may require you to convert your
source data to be similar to that found in the sample "RandomVotes.CSV" file in this repository. This script and all its functions
should be located in the same directory as your voter data to function properly.

Same goes for bugs, please let me know!
